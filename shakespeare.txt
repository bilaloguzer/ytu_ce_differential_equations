From fairest creatures we desire increase,That thereby beauty's rose might never die,But as the riper should by time decease,His tender heir might bear his memory
When forty winters shall beseige thy brow,And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,Thy youth's proud livery, so gazed on now,Will be a tatter'd weed, of small worth held
Look in thy glass, and tell the face thou viewest,Now is the time that face should form another;Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother
Unthrifty loveliness, why dost thou spend,Upon thyself thy beauty's legacy?Nature's bequest gives nothing but doth lend,And being frank she lends to those are free
Those hours, that with gentle work did frame,The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell,Will play the tyrants to the very same,And that unfair which fairly doth excel
Then let not winter's ragged hand deface,In thee thy summer, ere thou be distill'd:Make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place,With beauty's treasure, ere it be self-kill'd
Lo! in the orient when the gracious light,Lifts up his burning head, each under eye,Doth homage to his new-appearing sight,Serving with looks his sacred majesty
Music to hear, why hear'st thou music sadly?Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy.Why lovest thou that which thou receivest not gladly,Or else receivest with pleasure thine annoy
Is it for fear to wet a widow's eye,That thou consumest thyself in single life?Ah! if thou issueless shalt hap to die.The world will wail thee, like a makeless wife
For shame! deny that thou bear'st love to any,Who for thyself art so unprovident.Grant, if thou wilt, thou art beloved of many,But that thou none lovest is most evident
As fast as thou shalt wane, so fast thou growest,In one of thine, from that which thou departest;And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestowest,Thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest
When I do count the clock that tells the time,And see the brave day sunk in hideous night;When I behold the violet past prime,And sable curls all silver'd o'er with white
O, that you were yourself! but, love, you are,No longer yours than you yourself here live:Against this coming end you should prepare,And your sweet semblance to some other give
Not from the stars do I my judgment pluck;And yet methinks I have astronomy,But not to tell of good or evil luck,Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons' quality
When I consider every thing that grows,Holds in perfection but a little moment,That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows,Whereon the stars in secret influence comment
But wherefore do not you a mightier way,Make war upon this bloody tyrant, Time?And fortify yourself in your decay,With means more blessed than my barren rhyme
Who will believe my verse in time to come,If it were fill'd with your most high deserts?Though yet, heaven knows, it is but as a tomb,Which hides your life and shows not half your parts
Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?Thou art more lovely and more temperate:Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,And summer's lease hath all too short a date
Devouring Time, blunt thou the lion's paws,And make the earth devour her own sweet brood;Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws,And burn the long-lived phoenix in her blood
A woman's face with Nature's own hand painted,Hast thou, the master-mistress of my passion;A woman's gentle heart, but not acquainted,With shifting change, as is false women's fashion
So is it not with me as with that Muse,Stirr'd by a painted beauty to his verse,Who heaven itself for ornament doth use,And every fair with his fair doth rehearse
My glass shall not persuade me I am old,So long as youth and thou are of one date;But when in thee time's furrows I behold,Then look I death my days should expiate
As an unperfect actor on the stage,Who with his fear is put besides his part,Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,Whose strength's abundance weakens his own heart
Mine eye hath play'd the painter and hath stell'd,Thy beauty's form in table of my heart;My body is the frame wherein 'tis held,And perspective it is the painter's art
Let those who are in favour with their stars,Of public honour and proud titles boast,Whilst I, whom fortune of such triumph bars,Unlook'd for joy in that I honour most
Lord of my love, to whom in vassalage,Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit,To thee I send this written embassage,To witness duty, not to show my wit
Weary with toil, I haste me to my bed,The dear repose for limbs with travel tired;But then begins a journey in my head,To work my mind, when body's work's expired
How can I then return in happy plight,That am debarr'd the benefit of rest?When day's oppression is not eased by night,But day by night, and night by day, oppress'd
When, in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes,I all alone beweep my outcast state,And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,And look upon myself and curse my fate
When to the sessions of sweet silent thought,I summon up remembrance of things past,I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste
Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts,Which I by lacking have supposed dead,And there reigns love and all love's loving parts,And all those friends which I thought buried
If thou survive my well-contented day,When that churl Death my bones with dust shall cover,And shalt by fortune once more re-survey,These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover
Full many a glorious morning have I seen,Flatter the mountain-tops with sovereign eye,Kissing with golden face the meadows green,Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy
Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day,And make me travel forth without my cloak,To let base clouds o'ertake me in my way,Hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke
No more be grieved at that which thou hast done:Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud;Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun,And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud
Let me confess that we two must be twain,Although our undivided loves are one:So shall those blots that do with me remain,Without thy help by me be borne alone
As a decrepit father takes delight,To see his active child do deeds of youth,So I, made lame by fortune's dearest spite,Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth
How can my Muse want subject to invent,While thou dost breathe, that pour'st into my verse,Thine own sweet argument, too excellent,For every vulgar paper to rehearse
O, how thy worth with manners may I sing,When thou art all the better part of me?What can mine own praise to mine own self bring?And what is 't but mine own when I praise thee
Take all my loves, my love, yea, take them all;What hast thou then more than thou hadst before?No love, my love, that thou mayst true love call;All mine was thine before thou hadst this more
Those petty wrongs that liberty commits,When I am sometime absent from thy heart,Thy beauty and thy years full well befits,For still temptation follows where thou art
That thou hast her, it is not all my grief,And yet it may be said I loved her dearly;That she hath thee, is of my wailing chief,A loss in love that touches me more nearly
When most I wink, then do mine eyes best see,For all the day they view things unrespected;But when I sleep, in dreams they look on thee,And darkly bright are bright in dark directed
If the dull substance of my flesh were thought,Injurious distance should not stop my way;For then despite of space I would be brought,From limits far remote where thou dost stay
The other two, slight air and purging fire,Are both with thee, wherever I abide;The first my thought, the other my desire,These present-absent with swift motion slide
Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war,How to divide the conquest of thy sight;Mine eye my heart thy picture's sight would bar,My heart mine eye the freedom of that right
Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took,And each doth good turns now unto the other:When that mine eye is famish'd for a look,Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother
How careful was I, when I took my way,Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,That to my use it might unused stay,From hands of falsehood, in sure wards of trust
Against that time, if ever that time come,When I shall see thee frown on my defects,When as thy love hath cast his utmost sum,Call'd to that audit by advised respects
How heavy do I journey on the way,When what I seek, my weary travel's end,Doth teach that ease and that repose to say,'Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend
Thus can my love excuse the slow offence,Of my dull bearer when from thee I speed:From where thou art why should I haste me thence?Till I return, of posting is no need
So am I as the rich, whose blessed key,Can bring him to his sweet up-locked treasure,The which he will not every hour survey,For blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure
What is your substance, whereof are you made,That millions of strange shadows on you tend?Since every one hath, every one, one shade,And you, but one, can every shadow lend
O, how much more doth beauty beauteous seem,By that sweet ornament which truth doth give!The rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem,For that sweet odour which doth in it live
Not marble, nor the gilded monuments,Of princes, shall outlive this powerful rhyme;But you shall shine more bright in these contents,Than unswept stone besmear'd with sluttish time
Sweet love, renew thy force; be it not said,Thy edge should blunter be than appetite,Which but to-day by feeding is allay'd,To-morrow sharpen'd in his former might
Being your slave, what should I do but tend,Upon the hours and times of your desire?I have no precious time at all to spend,Nor services to do, till you require
That god forbid that made me first your slave,I should in thought control your times of pleasure,Or at your hand the account of hours to crave,Being your vassal, bound to stay your leisure
If there be nothing new, but that which is,Hath been before, how are our brains beguiled,Which, labouring for invention, bear amiss,The second burden of a former child
Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore,So do our minutes hasten to their end;Each changing place with that which goes before,In sequent toil all forwards do contend
Is it thy will thy image should keep open,My heavy eyelids to the weary night?Dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken,While shadows like to thee do mock my sight
Sin of self-love possesseth all mine eye,And all my soul and all my every part;And for this sin there is no remedy,It is so grounded inward in my heart
Against my love shall be, as I am now,With Time's injurious hand crush'd and o'er-worn;When hours have drain'd his blood and fill'd his brow,With lines and wrinkles; when his youthful morn
When I have seen by Time's fell hand defaced,The rich proud cost of outworn buried age;When sometime lofty towers I see down-razed,And brass eternal slave to mortal rage
Since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea,But sad mortality o'er-sways their power,How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea,Whose action is no stronger than a flower
Tired with all these, for restful death I cry,As, to behold desert a beggar born,And needy nothing trimm'd in jollity,And purest faith unhappily forsworn
Ah! wherefore with infection should he live,And with his presence grace impiety,That sin by him advantage should achieve,And lace itself with his society
Thus is his cheek the map of days outworn,When beauty lived and died as flowers do now,Before the bastard signs of fair were born,Or durst inhabit on a living brow
Those parts of thee that the world's eye doth view,Want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend;All tongues, the voice of souls, give thee that due,Uttering bare truth, even so as foes commend
That thou art blamed shall not be thy defect,For slander's mark was ever yet the fair;The ornament of beauty is suspect,A crow that flies in heaven's sweetest air
No longer mourn for me when I am dead,Then you shall hear the surly sullen bell,Give warning to the world that I am fled,From this vile world, with vilest worms to dwell
O, lest the world should task you to recite,What merit lived in me, that you should love,After my death, dear love, forget me quite,For you in me can nothing worthy prove
That time of year thou mayst in me behold,When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang,Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,Bare ruin'd choirs, where late the sweet birds sang
But be contented: when that fell arrest,Without all bail shall carry me away,My life hath in this line some interest,Which for memorial still with thee shall stay
So are you to my thoughts as food to life,Or as sweet-season'd showers are to the ground;And for the peace of you I hold such strife,As 'twixt a miser and his wealth is found
Why is my verse so barren of new pride,So far from variation or quick change?Why with the time do I not glance aside,To new-found methods and to compounds strange
Thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear,Thy dial how thy precious minutes waste;The vacant leaves thy mind's imprint will bear,And of this book this learning mayst thou taste
So oft have I invoked thee for my Muse,And found such fair assistance in my verse,As every alien pen hath got my use,And under thee their poesy disperse
Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid,My verse alone had all thy gentle grace,But now my gracious numbers are decay'd,And my sick Muse doth give another place
O, how I faint when I of you do write,Knowing a better spirit doth use your name,And in the praise thereof spends all his might,To make me tongue-tied, speaking of your fame
Or I shall live your epitaph to make,Or you survive when I in earth am rotten;From hence your memory death cannot take,Although in me each part will be forgotten
I grant thou wert not married to my Muse,And therefore mayst without attaint o'erlook,The dedicated words which writers use,Of their fair subject, blessing every book
I never saw that you did painting need,And therefore to your fair no painting set;I found, or thought I found, you did exceed,The barren tender of a poet's debt
Who is it that says most? which can say more,Than this rich praise, that you alone are you?In whose confine immured is the store,Which should example where your equal grew
My tongue-tied Muse in manners holds her still,While comments of your praise, richly compiled,Reserve their character with golden quill.And precious phrase by all the Muses filed
Was it the proud full sail of his great verse,Bound for the prize of all too precious you,That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse,Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew
Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing,And like enough thou know'st thy estimate:The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing;My bonds in thee are all determinate
When thou shalt be disposed to set me light,And place my merit in the eye of scorn,Upon thy side against myself I'll fight,And prove thee virtuous, though thou art forsworn
Say that thou didst forsake me for some fault,And I will comment upon that offence;Speak of my lameness, and I straight will halt,Against thy reasons making no defence
Then hate me when thou wilt; if ever, now;Now, while the world is bent my deeds to cross,Join with the spite of fortune, make me bow,And do not drop in for an after-loss
Some glory in their birth, some in their skill,Some in their wealth, some in their bodies' force,Some in their garments, though new-fangled ill,Some in their hawks and hounds, some in their horse
But do thy worst to steal thyself away,For term of life thou art assured mine,And life no longer than thy love will stay,For it depends upon that love of thine
So shall I live, supposing thou art true,Like a deceived husband; so love's face.May still seem love to me, though alter'd new;Thy looks with me, thy heart in other place
They that have power to hurt and will do none,That do not do the thing they most do show,Who, moving others, are themselves as stone,Unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow
How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame.Which, like a canker in the fragrant rose,Doth spot the beauty of thy budding name!O, in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose
Some say thy fault is youth, some wantonness;Some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport;Both grace and faults are loved of more and less;Thou makest faults graces that to thee resort
How like a winter hath my absence been.From thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year!What freezings have I felt, what dark days seen!What old December's bareness every where
From you have I been absent in the spring,When proud-pied April dress'd in all his trim.Hath put a spirit of youth in every thing,That heavy Saturn laugh'd and leap'd with him
The forward violet thus did I chide:Sweet thief, whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells,If not from my love's breath? The purple pride.Which on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells
Where art thou, Muse, that thou forget'st so long.To speak of that which gives thee all thy might?Spend'st thou thy fury on some worthless song,Darkening thy power to lend base subjects light
